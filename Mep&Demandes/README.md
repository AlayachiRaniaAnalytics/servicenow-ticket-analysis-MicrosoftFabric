## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes **MEP (Mises en Production)** and **Demandes (Requests)** extracted from **ServiceNow** using its REST API.  
The data is processed and visualized with **Microsoft Fabric** and **Power BI** to provide insights into workload distribution, execution times, and collaborator performance.  

The goal is to optimize production deployments and requests handling while tracking efficiency and delays.

## üöÄ Workflow
1. **Data Extraction**  
   - Pulled MEP and Demandes data from **ServiceNow API**.  
   - Stored the raw datasets in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse.  

2. **Data Transformation**  
   - Cleaned and structured the data using **Data Engineering (Spark/Notebooks)**.  
   - Normalized ticket types, execution times, and collaborator names.  

3. **Data Orchestration**  
   - Automated refresh pipelines with **Data Factory** to ensure up-to-date dashboards.  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Built dashboards in **Power BI** with KPIs and drill-down views for both **MEP** and **Demandes**.

## üìä Key Metrics & Insights
- **462** total tickets  
  - **296** Demandes  
  - **166** MEP  
- **10.83h** average duration for Demandes  
- **166.21h** average duration for MEP  
- Clear workload distribution by **collaborator** and **shifts**  
- Classification of top contributors

## üìà Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard provides:  
- Evolution of **MEP & Demandes over time** (monthly trend)  
- Tickets per **collaborator** and **shift**  
- Breakdown of MEP tickets by **HO (Heures Ouvr√©es)** vs **HNO (Heures Non Ouvr√©es)**  
- Average duration of tickets by type (MEP vs Demandes)  
- Ranking of collaborators by number of tickets handled and average resolution time
